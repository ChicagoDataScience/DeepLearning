	"content": " TLDR They are useful modules/models/blocks that can take graphs as inputs and generate good graph/node/edge embeddings based on graph properties (the way the edges are connecting the various nodes in the graph) in addition to node/edge attributes you may already have.\nWhy study them? Social networks, biological networks, consumer networks (your customers may be informed and informing others of your product/service via word-of-mouth etc) can be represented as a graph with each node having additional metadata/attributes (e.g., the node can be a customer and metadata can include age, education level, previos purchase if any etc). Once they are represented as a graph, we are interested in making predictions such as propensity to buy or respond to a marketing campaign, while taking into account influences from their neighbors (in the graph).\nNotation Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph. Let a generic node be represented by $u$ and a generic edge by $e$. In fact, let these also represent the node and edge attributes/features/embeddings (i.e., let $u$ be in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_u}$ and $e \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e}$). Then a GNN is a function $f$ that maps the graph (i.e., the collection of node and edge embeddings ) to a new collection of node and edge embeddings.\nThe Computation The way the function $f$ acts on the initial embeddings to get the final outputs can be thought in terms of layers and message passing.\n"

	"content": " Advanced Predictive Models and Applications for Business Analytics (IDS576) The goal of this class is to cover a subset of advanced machine learning techniques, after students have seen the basics of data mining (such as in in IDS 572) and machine learning (such as in IDS 575).\nBroadly, we will cover topics spanning deep learning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we will study popular deep learning architectures, their design choices and how they are trained. This will be motivated by business applications dealing with image, text and tabular data. Finally, we will look at online and reinforcement learning frameworks and their role in sequential decision making settings such as retail.\nA tentative list of topics is as follows:\n Backpropagation and feed forward neural networks Convolutional networks (CNNs) Recurrent networks and LSTMs Variational autoencoders (VAEs) Generative adversarial networks (GANs) Deep reinforcement learning and DQN Deep learning design choices such as optimizers (Adam), nonlinearities, embeddings, attention, dropout, batch normalization etc.  Previous Editions  Fall 2019 (has videos!)

	"content": " Course Logistics  Semester: Fall 2020 Lectures: Thursdays 3.30 PM to 6.00 PM Mode: Online synchronous (i.e., location is online). The course will be delivered over Zoom (an invite will be sent before the first day of class). See the online learning page for basic technology requirements. Staff  Instructor: Dr. Theja Tulabandhula (netid: theja) Teaching Assistant: Danial Mohseni-Taheri (netid: smohse3)  Communication: via slack. Office hours: online via slack and zoom (by appointment).  Textbook and Materials  Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (2016). Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2018).  Software  Any OS should be okay. If in doubt, run a virtual machine running linux (this will be discussed in the class). Some of the software we will work with are:  Python: Refer to this set of notes or this to get started in Python. Jupyter \u0026hellip;   Hardware  There will be varied computing resources needed for this course.  We will rely on Google Colab, especially the GPU/TPU to train our deep learning models. Try using a virtual machine with linux on your own computer if needed. A Windows virtual desktop is available at desktop.uic.edu if needed. You can refer to these two help pages to get started.    Assignments  09-03: Assignment 1. Due 09-16. Example template ipynb. 09-17: Assignment 2. Due 09-30. 10-01: Assignment 3. Due 10-14. 11-12: Assignment 4. Due 11-25.

Submission deadline is BEFORE 11.59 PM on the concerned day. Late submissions will have an automatic 20% penalty per day without exceptions. Use Blackboard for uploads.  Project  Students are expected to apply what they learn in the course and demonstrate their understanding by undertaking a suitable project. A preliminary documentation along with the scripts/codes/commands used is to be submitted on October 7th and a final version of the same is to be submitted on December 2nd. The projects will be presented to the rest of the class on December 3rd. The evaluation criteria and other details are available here. Submission deadline is BEFORE 11.59 PM on the concerned day. Late submissions will have an automatic 20% penalty per day. Use Blackboard for uploading your work as a single zip file.  Grades  Grades will be based on the assignments (4 times 10%), the project (see project evaluation criteria above) (50%) and course participation (10%).  Miscellaneous Information  This is a 4 credit graduate level course offered by the Information and Decision Sciences department at UIC. See the academic calendar for the semester timeline. Students who wish to observe their religious holidays (http://oae.uic.edu/religious-calendar/) should notify the instructor within one week of the first lecture date. Contact the instructor at the earliest, if you require any accommodations for access to and/or participation in this course. Refer to the academic integrity guidelines set by the university.  "

	"content": " Online Learning Details To maximize the learning experience, it will be good if students can meet the following basic technology requirements:\n At a minimum, students should have a device and an internet connection. A microphone, and a webcam would be highly recommended. See the Basic Technology Requirements link for more details.\n Laptop, Chromebook or Desktop Computer: Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself. This can result in somewhat reduced functionality, depending on your needs. If you do not have reliable access to a computer at home, ACCC may have a laptop to lend to you. Please fill out our request form at accc.uic.edu/forms/laptop-request\n Internet: Many service providers are offering connectivity solutions for students without access to Wi-Fi or the internet. The Illinois Citizens Utility Board is maintaining a comprehensive list of the available options here: citizensutilityboard.org/blog/2020/03/19/cubs-guide-utility-services-during-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.\n The State of Illinois is maintaining a map of publicly available internet hotspots across the state that can be used for academic-related needs. These hotspots are available from within a parked vehicle. The map, and additional information, can be viewed at www.ildceo.net/wifi.\n Additionally, the ACCC has a very limited supply of cellular hotspots available for those students who are unable to take advantage of the above offers. Please fill out our request form at accc.uic.edu/forms/laptop-request/.\n  Microphone: While this may be built into your computer, we recommend using an external device such as a USB microphone or headset.\n Webcam: A built-in camera may be installed on your laptop; if not, you can use an external USB camera for video conferencing.\n  "
