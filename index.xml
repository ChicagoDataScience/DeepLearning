      <description>Online Learning Details To maximize the learning experience, it will be good if students can meet the following basic technology requirements:
 At a minimum, students should have a device and an internet connection. A microphone, and a webcam would be highly recommended. See the Basic Technology Requirements link for more details.
 Laptop, Chromebook or Desktop Computer: Note that Chromebooks are used to perform a variety of browser-based tasks with most data and applications, such as Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Collaborate, Google Docs, and Office 365, residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself.</description>
